# wordpress-hacked-php
We had a Wordpress site hacked recently. Some of our template files had malicious PHP added to them, there were also new files added to the site. 

If you see code like this on your site, **you have very likely been HACKED.**

Look up some good resources to figure out what went wrong, and how you can rid your site of malicious code.
